What is python and why is it popular ?\n","\n"," Ans. Python is a high-level programming language that is designed to be simple and easy to understand by humans. It's syntax looks a lot like plain english , which makes it beginner -friendly , but at the same time it is powerful enough for advance tasks.  \n","\n","  One of the reason behind pythons populairty is it's Versatility. You can use it for many purposes such as web devlopment, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing and even building simple desktop or mobile apps. On the top of the that python has a huge collection of libraries and frameworks\n","\n","  (like Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc), which saves developers a lot of time because they don't have to write everything from scratch.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," 2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","\n"," Ans. The work of interpreter is to convert any program into machine language line by line similarly Python interpreter works , it converts the code line by line . It dosen't convert the whole code inton machine language at once like a compiler, but execute each line directly, which makes it easier to test and debug the program.\n","\n","\n","\n","3.   What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","\n"," Ans. Keywords are special, reserved words that Python itself uses to define the rules of the language (syntax). Because they already have a fixed meaning , you can't use them as names for variables, functions, or classes.\n"," Examples by role:\n","  \n","  a) if,else,elif - used for decision making\n","\n","     #example:\n","\n","           num=5\n","           if num>10:\n","           print(\"greater than 10\")\n","           elif num==5:\n","           print(\"equal to 5\")\n","           else:\n","           print(\"less than 5\")\n","  \n","  b) for, while, break, continue- loop\n","\n","    #example:\n","      \n","       for i in range(5)\n","       if i==3:\n","         break\n","       if i==0:  \n","         continue\n","        print(i)\n","\n","  c) True, False, None- represents the boolean value\n","\n","     #example\n","\n","       if is_student==True:\n","          print(\"you are a student\")\n","\n","       if has_passed==False:\n","          print(\"you have not passed the exam.\")\n","\n","       if grade is None:\n","          print(\"your grade is not available yet\")\n","\n","\n","  4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","\n","Ans. The answer of this question is No, the keywords cannot be used as a variable names as these keywords are special,reserved words that have a predefined meaning.\n","\n","   For example : In a certain recipe there are many keywords such as stirr, bake, mix . Now if you change the meaning of each word the recipe would become tough to follow . so , in this way the python keywords can't be used as variable names.\n","\n","\n"," 5. What is mutability in Python ?  \n","\n"," Ans.In Python, mutability means “can it be changed after it’s created?”\n","\n","If something is mutable, you can change its content without making a new object.\n","If something is immutable, once it’s created, it can’t be changed—you’d have to make a new object instead.\n","\n"," #example:\n","\n","  * Mutable (can change): list, dict, set\n","\n","  numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n","  numbers[0] = 10  # list is changed\n","  print(numbers)    # [10, 2, 3]\n","\n","\n","  6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","\n","Ans.   A list is like a whiteboard:\n","You can erase something, add new stuff, move things around. That’s why it’s mutable—Python designed lists for situations where you need to change, grow, or shrink the collection.\n","\n","  A tuple is like a printed page:\n","Once it’s printed, you can read it, copy it, or use it, but you can’t erase or change the words on the page. That’s why it’s immutable—tuples are meant to store fixed data that shouldn’t change.\n","\n","\n"," 7. What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators in python ?\n","\n","Ans.  == → checks value\n","\n"," #Asks: “Do these two things look the same?”\n","\n"," #example:\n","\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","print(a == b)   # True (because the lists have the same values)\n","\n","\n"," is → checks identity (memory location)\n","\n"," #Asks: “Are these two things literally the same object in memory?”\n","\n"," #example:\n","\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","print(a is b)   # False (they look the same, but live in different places in memory)\n","\n","\n","\n"," 8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. Logical operators in Python are like words we use to connect conditions (True/False checks). They help us make decisions.\n","\n","There are 3 logical operators:\n","\n","  1.  and → both must be True\n","\n","Think of it like: “I’ll go outside if it’s sunny and warm.”\n","\n","sunny = True\n","\n","warm = True\n","\n","print(sunny and warm)   # True (because both are True)\n","\n","2. or → at least one must be True\n","\n","Think of it like: “I’ll eat pizza if it has cheese or chicken.”\n","\n","cheese = False\n","\n","chicken = True\n","\n","print(cheese or chicken)   # True (because one of them is True)\n","\n","3. not → flips True to False, False to True\n","\n","Think of it like: “I’ll stay home if it’s not sunny.”\n","\n","sunny = False\n","\n","print(not sunny)   # True (because sunny was False)\n","\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. Type casting in Python means changing one type of data into another type.\n","\n","Think of it like changing clothes: the person is the same, but the outfit is different.\n","\n","   \n","  #Examples:\n","\n","String → Integer\n","\n","age = \"25\"         # this is a string\n","\n","age_num = int(age)     # now it’s an integer\n","\n","print(age_num + 5)     # 30\n","\n"," 10. What is difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","\n","Ans. Implicit type casting (Type Conversion)\n","\n"," * Done automatically by Python.\n","\n"," * Happens when Python safely changes one type into another without you asking.\n","\n"," Explicit type casting (Type Casting)\n","\n"," * Done manually by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), str().\n","\n","\n","  11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. Conditional statements in Python (like if, elif, and else) are used to make decisions in your code.\n","\n","\n","Think of it like this:\n","\n","When you’re deciding what to do in real life, you usually check a condition:\n","\n","If it’s raining, take an umbrella.\n","\n","Else, wear sunglasses.\n","\n","Python works the same way!\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","age = 18\n","\n","if age >= 18:\n","\n","    print(\"You can vote!\")\n","else:\n","\n","    print(\"You cannot vote.\")\n","\n","  12. How does the elif statment work ?\n","\n","Ans. The elif statement in Python means \"else if\".\n","It’s used when you have more than two choices to check.\n","\n","Think of it like this:\n","\n","👉 Example in real life:\n","\n","If you’re hungry, eat food.\n","\n","Elif you’re thirsty, drink water.\n","\n","Else, just relax.\n","\n","So instead of only having yes or no choices (with just if and else), elif lets you add extra options in between.\n","\n","  13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","\n","Ans. 🔹 For loop -\n","\n","A for loop is used when you already know how many times you want to repeat something.\n","\n","It’s like counting steps.\n","\n","👉 Real life example:\n","Imagine you have 5 chocolates, and you want to eat them one by one:\n","\n","For each chocolate in the box → eat it.\n","\n","🔹 While loop\n","\n","A while loop is used when you don’t know how many times you’ll need to repeat something — you just keep going until a condition is no longer true.\n","\n","It’s like waiting for something to stop.\n","\n","👉 Real life example:\n","You keep watching YouTube while your internet is working:\n","\n","While internet is on → keep watching.\n","\n","  14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n","         \n","Ans. A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know how many times something will happen, but you know it should continue until a condition is no longer true.\n","\n","👉 Real-life example:\n","Imagine you’re waiting for a bus.\n","\n","You don’t know how many minutes it will take.\n","\n","You just keep waiting while the bus hasn’t arrived.\n","\n","That’s a while loop situation.\n","\n","💡 Why not a for loop here?\n","Because with a for loop, you’d have to guess, like: “Wait for 10 minutes”.\n","But in real life, the bus might come earlier or later — you don’t know the exact count.\n","\n","That’s why a while loop fits perfectly.        \n","\n","# **Practical Questions**\n","\n"," 1.
