It helps organize code into reusable and modular units.\n","\n","**Question2. ->** What is a class in OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n","\n","**Question3. ->** What is an object in OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own data and behavior.\n","\n","**Question4. ->** What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Diffrence are as follows :-\n","\n","*Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.\n","\n","*Encapsulation binds data and methods together, restricting direct access to data.\n","\n","**Question5. ->** What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__) that start and end with __. They define how objects behave with operators and built-in functions.\n","\n","**Question6.->** Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","\n","**Answer ->** Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent), enabling code reusability and hierarchy.\n","\n","**Question7.->** What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Polymorphism means the same function or method name can have different implementations depending on the object or class.\n","\n","**Question8.->** How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Encapsulation is achieved by using private (__var), protected (_var), and public variables, along with getter and setter methods to control data access.\n","\n","**Question9.->** What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","**Answers ->** A constructor is the __init__ method in Python, automatically called when an object is created to initialize attributes.\n","\n","**Question10. ->** What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->**\n","\n","*Class method (@classmethod) takes cls as the first argument and works with class-level data.\n","\n","*Static method (@staticmethod) does not take self or cls; it behaves like a regular function inside the class.\n","\n","**Question11. ->**  What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Python does not support true method overloading, but it can be achieved by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n","\n","**Question12. ->** What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the same name as a parent class method, replacing the parent’s implementation.\n","\n","**Question13. ->** What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** The @property decorator is used to define getter methods, allowing class attributes to be accessed like regular variables without explicitly calling methods.\n","\n","**Question14. ->** Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Polymorphism increases flexibility and reusability, allowing the same interface to be used for different data types or classes.\n","\n","**Question15. ->** What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is defined using the abc module and contains abstract methods that must be implemented in child classes.\n","\n","**Question16. ->** What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Advantages of OOPs as follows:\n","\n","\n","\n","*   Code reusability\n","*   Modularity\n","*   Scalability\n","*   Easier maintenance\n","*   Data security through encapsulation\n","\n","**Question17. ->** What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Differences are as follows :\n","*   Class variable: Shared by all objects of a class.\n","*   Instance variable: Unique to each object.\n","\n","**Question18. ->** What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n","\n","**Question19. ->** Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n","\n","Answer -> Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods are follows:-\n","\n","*  __str__: Returns a human-readable string representation of an object.\n","*  __repr__: Returns a developer-oriented representation for debugging.\n","\n","**Question20. ->** What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** super() is used to call methods from a parent class in the child class, often used for constructors in inheritance.\n","\n","**Question21. ->** What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** The __del__ method is a destructor, automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed to release resources.\n","\n","**Question22. ->** What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","**Answer ->** The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod:\n","\n","*  @staticmethod: Does not take self or cls. Works like a normal function inside a class.\n","*  @classmethod: Takes cls as the first argument and can modify class-level attributes.\n","\n","**Question23. ->** How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Inheritance allows child classes to override parent methods. Polymorphism ensures that the correct version of the method is called depending on the object.\n","\n","**Question24.->** What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","**Answer ->** Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by returning self from methods.\n","\n","\n","\n","# Practical Questions :\n","\n","**Question 1->** Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic message. Create a child class Dog that overrides the speak() method to print “Bark”.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nj_9sCBFlqfK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Animal:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"This is an animal sound\")\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Bark\")\n","\n","a = Animal()\n","a.speak()\n","d = Dog()\n","d.speak()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hBJISzsmxyS4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759154530101,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Komal Bajpai","userId":"07918923630787443674"}},"outputId":"a7749e91-d9f0-4b7b-dc83-75d401fafd9b"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["This is an animal sound\n","Bark\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question2.->** Write a program to create an abstract class Shape with a method area().
